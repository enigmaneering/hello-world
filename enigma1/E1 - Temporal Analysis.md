### Neural Calculus

Now that we've taken a dip into multiplexing _processes,_ let's step back a bit and consider some more practical
examples!  One of the most important features of a neural impulse engine is the ability to coordinate many
calculations on a regular interval, allowing for real time differential analysis and integration (much like P.I.D.)

To start this process, we need a signal we can _observe_
