### The International Phonetic Alphabet

IPA is the international standard for phonetic description.  Fortunately, it's a _very finite_ set of phonemes which
are shared amongst languages!  As I mentioned before, English only uses about 46 phonemes for everyday speech - though,
the vocal box is a highly flexible instrument, and that set is more of a _guide_ than a rule.  We'll eventually
evolve this to include a broader set, but for now we'll stick to what _I_ currently know.  As of this point, I've
still yet to flesh out the prior enigmas that will facilitate this one - but I have research I'd like to leave myself
behind for when I visit this later on.

First, Carnegie Mellon University has the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary - which provides a list of IPA to corpora 
translations which could be cross-referenced into WordNet for definitions and synonyms.

Second, espeak.sourceforge.net has a C library for non-IPA based speech generation (I could be wrong, I have no
internet right now to validate if it uses IPA)

Third, pronunciationstudio.com has an entire library of audio samples you could pull down tied to each diagram of the
articulators and larynx - this would give a reference for what to machine learn towards for a first iteration
