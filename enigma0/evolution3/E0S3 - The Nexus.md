### Clustering Thoughts
Now that we can locate a thought, it doesn't really do us any good without an _endpoint_ from which to absolutely 
reference the relative paths from.  In that, we reach our final _thought_ type: the Nexus!

    // A nexus definition

    package std

    type Nexus struct {
        Entity
        Idea[map[string]any]
    }

    // Nexus controls

    package nexus

    var Origin std.Nexus

    func Reveal[T any](endpoint string, path std.Path, code ...string) T { }
    
    func Describe[T any](revelation T, endpoint string, path std.Path, code ...string) { }

A nexus is a pairing of an Idea and an Entity - which is a name and description paired with a unique identifier.  While
you can create your own Nexus, the `nexus` package holds the `Origin` Nexus shared amongst the entire JanOS instance.
The `nexus` package also provides a way of identifying _other_ nexuses
