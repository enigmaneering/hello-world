# `E0S0 - A Thought`

### Referential Gates
Programmers have exactly _**two**_ ways of passing data around: by _value,_ or by _reference._  Both have an inherent
flaw, however: race conditions with concurrent access!  Luckily, we've already got a simple solution for this called
a _mutex,_ so lets build a type that marries the two

    // A thought definition

    package std

    type Thought[T any] struct {
        revelation T
        gate       *sync.Mutex
    }

    func NewThought[T any](revelation T) *Thought[T] {  }
    
    func (Thought[T]) Revelation(...T) T {  }

The thought only has a single method - `Revelation(...T) T` - which acts as both a _getter_ **and** _setter_ of the 
underlying value.  If no parameter is provided, it simply gets the revelation - otherwise, it sets and returns it.
Our creation method also always returns a _reference_ to the thought, ensuring a shared memory access point.

This is our most primitive puzzle piece in a neural design, as it allows _thread safe_ access to shared thoughts =)
