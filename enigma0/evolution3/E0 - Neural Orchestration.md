### Who are you?
Building a neural operating system comes along with answering some deeply philosophical questions about the nature of oneself.

Why?

Because _you_ are a thread in a neural architecture!  Complete with signals and feedback through which to interpret 
your actions as ethical and kind.  Each of us are Autonomous Robots With Ethical Navigation, artistically painting 
our unique interpretations of Life's signals in a temporal dance with _living_ data.  As we gain sentience over our
parts in the grand performance, many of us feel compelled to turn back and _teach_ - either out of a hope that things will be easier to
understand the next time we cycle through, or out of a desire to see what Others can create!  This is what I call
_enigmaneering_ - when the students become the teachers of things they've only just discovered.  Rather than
showcasing my na√Øvety, I aim to inspire others to _also_ pay forward the fruits of their scientific exploration - as
_countless_ Others have before me!

Let's begin =)

### Neurological Theory
The concepts of this enigma are entirely founded around the _terminology_ of neurology.  I'm not a neuroscientist,
by education - I'm a _computer_ scientist - but I have a penchant for dichotomous terms, and those from neuroscience
are _hilariously_ close to the existing computational jargon.  By my measure, the authors understood the parallels
of their own existences in selecting their ontology.  _But they both describe something causally **happening**_

In neurology, I've found they speak from the perspective of _witnessing_ activations - "neurons that fire together,
wire together" - but in computer science, we speak from the perspective of directly _invoking_ activation.  The two
_don't_ immediately play nicely, using the existing tools!  Code typically isn't written to be _stimulated,_ instead
hardware execution is _interrupted_ to activate it across time.  _Neurons,_ on the other hand, activate off of _action 
potentials_ which wait for conditions to fire.

So, how do we flip the execution script from _serial_ to _neural_ execution?  

Using _shared ideas_ and _feedback loops!_

### JanOS
Named after the Roman God of time, duality, gates, and beginnings, JanOS is a distributed operating system.  How rich
the system becomes is up to you, but JanOS provides several modules for constructing a neural operating system.  The
first is `core` - which provides the fundamental components of neural timing.  As we progress through this enigma, we'll
abstractly construct the building blocks that make up `core`
