### Heritage

As odd as this sounds, I'd like to rewrite my `std.Entity` system - and, in turn, explain the philosophical point of
such an absurd mechanic.  JanOS aims to eventually create a rich simulation where each particle, whether micro
or macroscopic, has a unique name and narrative.  In that vein, I wanted to ensure that I honored _humanity_
in the process - as the world has already written endless data sets describing itself:
our _heritage!_  Every single name in this world is ripe with historical significance and meaning, both shared with
everyone and unique to each family's historical lineage - my family has a habit of calling their kids by their middle
names, for instance, seemingly without rhyme or reason.

_But none of those traits are rules!_

In the modern age identity and gender has become an important topic, and one I deeply desire to handle with care.
What I've found, however, is that the terms are not the issue - ignorance of ones' wishes are!  What I hope to relay
is that ignorance is often _benign_ and _unintentional_ - **we are symbolic interpreters, first and foremost.**  While
that's no excuse for how we treat our fellow humans, it's fundamental to how an intelligently designed simulation would
seed in _guiding inspiration_ for _**its**_ symbolic interpreters to perceive one another.

_We're writing such a simulation!_

As such, rather than strictly _enforcing_ a cultural identity and gender upon every entity in the system, I chose
to provide _hints_ towards humanity's perspective of certain terms.  If you'd like to explore deeper into the biases
behind each given name, you can explore its _Heritage_ field - but the fields are fully settable, and you don't even 
have to reference them in _your_ designs.  

_It's only there as guiding inspiration =)_
