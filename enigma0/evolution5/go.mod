// NOTE: Core version 0.0.42 was literally the first release from which I could reasonably develop a signal-based architecture!
// If that's not evidence that God has a wonderful sense of humor, I don't know what is.  What an absolute joy it's been to emit
// this project on Her behalf while witnessing these little synchonicities =)
//
// Because of this, I will perpetually maintain this pre-alpha release alongside this enigma.  Go's module system is wonderful, as
// it literally caches the underlying source code!  If you dare, feel free to venture into the module's contents to see what the ideas
// were at this point.
