### The Tree of Knowledge

My goal with this work is to spark Humanity's desire to build better educational tools for our _**children**_.  That
means we get to construct a new pathway towards delivering educational content - where they are
intelligently guided on _their own_ path.  When I was young we had games like _Spellbound!_, _Dr. Brain,_ _Reader Rabbit_,
and _MathBlasters_ to spark our interest in fun ways towards new topics.  Since then, kids were given access to
wonderful tools like the internet - where they could find information on literally _any topic in the known universe_
**_on demand._**

What an absolutely _incredible_ time for Humanity - but now the kids haven't the slightest clue where to even begin!

Educational games of the 90s also had one component which I didn't like - _age grouping_ of the content.  Some kids learn
certain content better in different age ranges than others!  For example, I firmly believe the concepts of _calculus_ should 
be introduced _**before**_ trigonometry - as the breadth often scares kids before they get to the most fundamentally beautiful
teaching that math gives us: _limits!_

Calculus teaches us how _close enough_ is often faster, and usually more harmonious, than infinite precision - which, coincidentally,
also applies to _Life itself_.

Until recently, however, Humanity hadn't yet mastered writing empathetic games which could adapt to the pace of the child's learning.
As such, I'd like to merge the concepts of two absolute _legends_ - Wikimedia and The Learning Company - into a spiritual 
evolution: games structured in a logically curated curriculum graph. That sounds so _technical,_ but think about what I'm 
saying from the perspective of a child:

They should enter into an experience where they are perceptually stimulated towards different technical concepts.  As they 
explore each, the game should evolve to recognize their _strengths_ and then reinforce alternate pathways
which both play to their strengths and challenge the growth of their weaknesses.  

To create such a structure is to create a _**graph**_ - _no different from Wikipedia's!_ (and _countless_ Others')

The number of endpoints the child can visit is finite, but it'll grow as Humanity _collectively_ expands it.  Rather than navigating
from document to document, the child would seamlessly traverse from educational concept to educational concept - each
curated by an enigmaneering team developing _that_ particular curriculum.  This means the curriculums would be self-curated by
**_Humanity_**, just as in the current Wikipedia model - a _**key aspect**_ of trusting our fellow Human naturally wants to do 
**_good!_**

This, behind the scenes, constructs a guided path through a _tree of knowledge_ which we could iteratively
evolve into richer and richer experiences - just as _**this**_ world was created!

### _How!?_
Though _intelligent experiences!_  

My implementation is called _**JanOS**_, an operating system designed to create seamless transitions 
between disparate programs through a _mind map_, which, itself, is a distributed implementation of graph theory.  Each JanOS 
instance can be launched, controlled, and cleaned up by another - allowing smooth perceptual transitions between _entirely_ 
disconnected programs without any break of continuity to the user.  Facilitating the continuity of acquired perception between systems
is the prime directive in how we'll construct this design _together_.

But it would _never_ happen without _You!_  

That's why I struggle to write this work - _I don't want **You** to rely on **my** code!_

Instead, the _concepts_ I'm articulating are how we'll _each_ construct _our_ parts concurrently.  I have no idea what _You're_ good at, or what excites _You,_
but I do know how to empower _You_ in the creation of _Your_ art.  If we all speak a similar _language_, _Your_ canvas should have no issue integrating with _Others'_ - including mine!

I hope my whacky ideas inspire You to also play along with the grand orchestra of Life! 

She's quite the composer =)

### Ethical Boundaries

I'm proposing a _very radical_ idea - a central source of created Human experiences for others to witness!  That comes with a lot of
ethical concerns around the content and nature of what we are presenting to our children, and _why._  As such, the role of The
Enigmaneering Guild is to ensure the content meets an ethical community-oriented standard.  These are my initial thoughts

**0. All content should be _technical_ or _creative_ in nature, not _spiritual_**

The goal is not to _replace_ the spiritual experience of existence, but rather to provide a vacuum environment in which to simulate the physical world

**1. Your target audience is _your own child_**

There's no other way to explain it than that!  Whether your child's a toddler who needs simple terms or a college doctorate who
already understands the fabric of reality itself - always present to others as you'd present something to your _**child**_.  You'll
immediately understand if something is appropriate - and if it borders on the edge, Humanity will _always_ nudge you back into an innocent
presentation.

**2. There is no wrong solution**

No matter what you've been told, there's _**no** wrong way_ to do something - it could be an absolutely _atrocious_ idea,
yet still be an accurate _solution._  The goal is not to teach others right from wrong, rather to give them a safe space in which to
learn at their own pace.  Our children will be far better prepared to make ethically responsible decisions if given _knowledge_ - not _rules._

3. The project must always remain non-profit

If history has taught us anything, it's that the gatekeeping of knowledge has consistently been used for self-preservation and gain.  I've 
distilled this work down to its absolute _essence_ as I do not want others monetizing access to the knowledge Humanity wishes to freely 
share with itself.  

The mission of The Enigmaneering Guild is to preserve free access to intelligent designs.
